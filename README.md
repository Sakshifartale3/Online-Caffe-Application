# Online-Caffe-Application
An online café application is a web-based platform that allows users to browse a café menu, place orders, and sometimes even make payments online. 

The application typically consists of three core technologies:
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) – Structures the webpage and defines elements like menus, buttons, and forms.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) – Styles the webpage, making it visually appealing with colors, layouts, and animations.
JavaScript – Adds interactivity, such as updating the cart dynamically and handling user inputs.

Features of the Online Café Application
Homepage – Displays the café’s introduction, special offers, and featured items.
Menu Page – Lists food and drinks with prices and images.
Cart Functionality – Allows users to add and remove items.
Order Form – Collects customer details and order preferences.
